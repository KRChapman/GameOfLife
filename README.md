# Conway's Game of Life

A visual representation of my algorithm to display Conway's Game of Life.

## Issues

It is not responsive. The design is meant to be used on a large screen and not 
for mobile. This is my one and only project that is not responsive.

## Getting Started

[Check it out here!](https://krchapman.github.io/GameOfLife/)

## Using

### Starting

Press the video button to see a video from youtube that has Conway himself explaining the Game of Life.Then Press the white lettered run button to get the simulation started. Whether it is running or not clicking on the cells creates or destroys respectivly.

### Speed

Right hand side select the speed. The games animation logic uses requestAnimationFrame to determine the speed based on the slider value.

### Gliders

Use the glider buttons to toggle your mouse clicks from creating 1 cell at a time to the glider pattern. It can move accross the game board.

### Board Size

On the bottom left select Large and small Board sizes
